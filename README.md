# API DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES

## Folder structure
- Each micro-service should have have one folder with its name (postfix `-api`)
	`For example: catalog-api for Product Catalog micro-service`
	
- Each API should be defined following [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) standalization (version 3.0.2)
	`Please take a look at example.json inside example folder`

- Some [tips](https://confluence.teko.vn/display/TekBack/RESTful+API+standards) for designing a RESTful API

- Each folder should have a `README.md` which explains the service's role

## Naming your API
- An api should be named following the resource it reflects
    `Catalog service has apis over product resources, so it should have an api description file named: product-api.yaml`

## Creating or Updating an API
- Create a new file inside your service's folder (create one if not yet exists)

- Use the template inside example folder or start with your own

- Create a pull request & assign it to tien.dv@teko.vn

- Your pull request must specify the original pull request which contains changes made to your original service repository
